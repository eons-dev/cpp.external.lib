# External C++ Libraries

This is a collection of libraries others have written that we find to be useful in our programs. We have reposted them here in order to more readily integrate them into our devops pipeline and made available on the [Infrastructure repository](https://infrastructure.tech)

The libraries are as follows:
* Argparse: https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse.git
* Rapidjson: https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson.git
* Platform: https://github.com/steinwurf/platform.git
* Zlib: http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.12.tar.gz
* CPR: https://github.com/libcpr/cpr.git
* Restbed: https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed

The license we chose for this repo is AGPL as a "lowest common denominator" of the licenses used. However, you should (must) respect the licenses of the individual repositories when using code from this repo.
